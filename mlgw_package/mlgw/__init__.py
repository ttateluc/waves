mlgw
====
Package for a ML model to generate a GW signal by a BBH coalescence. The model makes use of a PCA model for reducing wave dimensionality. A Mixture of Expert model makes a regression from orbital parameters to the reduced representation of a wave.
The packacke has 4 modules:
	GW_generator.py
		It holds an implementation of the full ML model used to reconstruct a WF. It is a lal style method for creating a waveform. It is ready to use. Loads authomatically EM_MoE and ML_routines modules.
	EM_MoE.py
		It holds a Mixture of Experts model as well as a softmax regression model required for it.
	ML_routines.py
		It holds some useful ML routines such as PCA model (required by the MLGW_generator) and a routine for performing basis function expansion.
	GW_helper.py
		It holds some routines useful for generating a GW dataset and a computing mismatch between waveforms. This is not strictly required by the model but it is useful for training the model. Used by module fit_model.py
	fit_model.py
		It holds some routines to effectively fit the model.
